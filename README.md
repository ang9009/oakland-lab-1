# Fundies 2 Lab Template Repo

Welcome to CS 2511 (the labs associated with CS 2510)!

The labs are designed to prepare you for the CS 2510 homework assignments. Please check Canvas for the lab assignment for this week.

 

## Grading:

Each lab grade will be 0%, 75%, or 100%. Any reasonable attempt will get a 100%. Any empty submission will get a 0%.

Each lab will be graded on effort, so it is recommended to submit what you have at the end of the lab, even if it is not complete. This is not homework!

The lowest 2 lab grades over the semester will be dropped.

If you need to miss class, please talk to your CS2511 Lab Leader about any missed material. We don't want you to come to class if you are sick!
